<h1>grap TODO_GRAPVERSION</h1>
grap matches graph patterns within binaries.
It comes as a stand-alone CLI application (with a Capstone-based disassembler), as python bindings and as this IDA plugin.

<h2>Pattern Search</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Within the <b>Pattern Search</b> tab, you can match existing patterns against the state of the binary being analyzed</li>
	<li>Since the Control Flow Graph (CFG) is created from the current IDA database, you might want to do it again later in the analysis process</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pattern Generation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Within the <b>Pattern Generation</b> tab, first parse the CFG with the "Load CFG" button</li>
	<li>Then, within IDA View, add a root node and target nodes (with a right click)</li>
	<li>Click on "Generate a pattern" to see the pattern within the plugin view</li>
	<li>You can save this pattern to a file and match from the <b>Pattern Search</b> tab</li>
</ul>
